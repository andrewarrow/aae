1. you might already know your mac can say Hello if you just type say Hello

but did you know you can save that audio to an AIFF file?
notice the 31440 byte file hello.aiff in this directory now.

2. lets look at these 31,440 numbers and try and see what they have to do with the sound "hello"

ok it's a bunch of numbers, pages and pages of them and sometimes blocks of zeros.
