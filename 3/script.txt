1. you might already know your mac can say Hello if you just type say Hello

but did you know you can save that audio to an AIFF file?
notice the 31440 byte file hello.aiff in this directory now.

2. lets look at these 31,440 numbers and try and see what they have to do with the sound "hello"

ok it's a bunch of numbers, pages and pages of them and sometimes blocks of zeros.

3. if we open hello.aiff in an audio editing program we can see these 
numbers plotted on a nice graph from -1.0 to 1.0

and i can zoom into just a small section vs. viewing the entire thing.

4. So our first question should be, those numbers we saw in the file are not from -1.0 to 1.0. They aren't floating point numbers at all. They were just random intergers like 87 255 243 etc. How do these numbers get converted into floats?
